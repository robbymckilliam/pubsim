The pubsim library is released under the CRAPL academic license http://matt.might.net/articles/crapl/. As such it comes with no guarantees as to correctness/intelligibility/good coding practice. I also don't offer any support. If you can't get things running you are welcome to send me an email, but you might not get a reply.

I tend to use scripts of one form or other to actually run the simulations. In the past I have used both Ruby and Python for this, but these days I mostly use Scala. Some example scripts are contained in the examples folder. I am continually adding to this software so there is no guarantee that the scripts will continue to work forever. Infact, there is no garauntee that they work right now!
